# Hi, I'm Olek! 👋

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a passionate **Applied Computer Science** student at AGH, always exploring new tech and building interesting projects. My focus is on creating clean, efficient code while solving real-world problems. Currently, I'm diving into **full-stack development**, learning **React Native**, and mastering **TypeScript**.

## 🔧 Technologies & Tools

- **Languages**: JavaScript, Python, C++
- **Frontend**: React, React Native, Material UI (MUI)
- **Backend**: Flask, Node.js
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, SQL
- **Tools**: Git, Figma, MATLAB

## 🚀 Current Focus

I'm currently working on side projects to expand my skillset, from **web apps** to **mobile development** and **UI/UX design**. I love experimenting with new technologies, optimizing performance, and creating beautiful, intuitive UIs.

## 📚 What's Next

- Continue learning **full-stack** development with **React** & **TypeScript**
- Dive deeper into **UI/UX design** and **mobile development** with **React Native**

## 🤝 Let's Connect

Feel free to reach out if you'd like to collaborate, share ideas, or chat about tech. I'm always excited to connect with fellow developers and learners.
